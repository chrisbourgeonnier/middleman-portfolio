- name: Basho
  slogan: A map of your best memories, past and yet to come
  description: BASHO is a mobile-first web app where users can curate their map of Tokyo with the places that matter to them. Unlike Google Maps, BASHO lets them sort and customize their pins, but most of all, it allows them to create as many tags as they want to label their places and easily find them later on.
